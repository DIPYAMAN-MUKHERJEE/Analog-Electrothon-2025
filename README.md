**Project: Pulse Duration Detection Circuit Design**
# Analog-Electrothon-2025
this is my circuit which i submitted for the Analog PS of the Electrothon 2025

Tools Used: LTspice

Designed and simulated a comparator-based pulse detection circuit capable of identifying input pulses that remain high for a minimum predefined time duration.

Utilized LTspice for circuit simulation and verification, ensuring accurate timing response and reliable detection behavior under various input conditions.

Implemented precise timing thresholds through RC time constants and comparator reference levels to distinguish valid pulses from spurious signals.
